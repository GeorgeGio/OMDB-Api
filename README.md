**Note: This project makes use of CORS Unblock Extension.**
Here is a link for one on Chrome: [Cors Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)

## Overview

The project will ask the user via a modal for a film/movie they like. From this film/movie we will display the poster of the film/movie they like using OMDBApi, then the name of 3 similar films/movies they may like from TasteDive Api and the associated posters from OMBDApi.

### The challenge

You and your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned to create a real-world front-end application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## My process

We decided on our first API OMDBApi. From this we looked at what information was returned and decided how we would use that information. In this case, to the display the movie poster. We then decided that we could use TasteDive API to return movies similar to the one the user chose. But in addition to just returning those movie names we decided to return the posters for those similar movies too. 

We then set up the project and start with the Kanban wall/Todos to break the task up into manageable tasks we could all tackle separately and jointly. We worked alone and using paired programming to develop and discuss the task. Supporting each other along the way. We also communicated via Slack to ensure we all knew what was going on as we worked on parts individually. We commented out code and chose meaningful variable names to give our project good readability. We fixed any bugs as a team before moving on. We created separate branches as per the todos. And we checked/merged our code regularly. 

We decided to get the project working with a temporary basic html page before deciding on the css framework as it wasn't clear from the brief whether we should use Bootstrap or not (the readme said Use Bootstrap and rubric said we shouldn't)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma
- GitHub


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```


### Continued development

We could check that the movie entered exists and if not, tell the user to check their entry and try again.


### Useful resources

- [TasteDive API](https://tastedive.com/read/api) - This helped us choose and use the TasteDive Api for getting similar movies to the user chosen movie.
- [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) - The documenation here helped us utilise the movie database for our project to return the movie poster associated with the respective movie.
